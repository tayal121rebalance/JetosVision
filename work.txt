- Make the askme page respond to enter along with pressing ask
I tried making changes but found that the ask me button has an onClick event already attached and I have no idea about adding an enter button so I couldn't do that.


- The blue text “****Your Personal Research assistant” Gets cut out in mobile phone****
I have fixed it it was an error because of explicit height and I have made it responsive so you'll not face any issues regarding it.

- Mobile Number 4 at the top
made it responsive. It's showing responsiveness in Chrome tools hope it must be fixed.


- Mobile Gray square splitting at the top
Made them settle in the center of the workboxes hope it must be accurate and I am attaching some files regarding the issue.


- Mobile gray square absent on the phone
Fixed it and it's correct in Chrome tools must be ok on other devices too.


- Find free vectors and download and use them in the UI
I tried using the Figma svg and it worked and made it exactly what you wanted


- Toggle buttons on the FAQ
I couldn't do that as it requires extra JavaScript which I tried but it started to disturb the existing UI


- Make the gray boxes symmetry with the darker boxes
Made it symmetry. It was an issue of width and alignment and I had fixed it.
